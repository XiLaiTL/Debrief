## Introduction

In Duckov, you can enjoy a chubby extraction too! The backpack and results screens now show your actual profit (after deductions) and the duration of the match.

## How to Use

### For Steam Users

1. Visit the [Steam Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3588652490) and subscribe to the Mod
2. Launch the game, go to the Mods section in the main menu, and enable the Mod

### For Non-Steam Users

1. Go to the [Release](https://github.com/dzj0821/DisplayTotalReward/releases) page and download the Mod archive
2. In your game installation directory, create a `Mods` folder inside the `Duckov_Data` folder (if it doesn't already exist), and extract the Mod archive there. The final structure should be: `Duckov_Data->Mods->DisplayTotalReward->DisplayTotalReward.dll`
3. Launch the game, go to the Mods section in the main menu, and enable the Mod
